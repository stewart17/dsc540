    "I plan to approach this project by taking each data set one at a time and formatting it. The end goal is of course to merge all these data into a single dataset in order to do some visualization work. With that in my mind, I cannot just clean each dataset as if they are separate entities. To that end, I will be formatting each file with the idea that I am trying to find a relationship between a country's CO2 emissions, the factors that influence those emissions, a country's Covid rates, and a country's vaccination rate. There may of course not be any such relationship, but I am entering the project with the idea that some relationship will be found or created. Units will be standard across data, errors corrected, standards for missing values, and bad data removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset offers a particular glimpse into how a country operates. The emissions dataset shows the interplay between a country's emissions, GDP, population, and energy consumption/production. The Covid cases API offers a snapshot into a country's struggle with a deadly virus. And the vaccination dataset shows a country's primary defense against said virus. In each case, we are viewing a country's struggle through various lenses and indirectly, how a country views or attempts to overcome these problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Herein lies the ethical implications of my project. Say there exists a country with high GDP, high CO2 emissions, high vaccination rates, as well as high Covid cases and deaths. What does this say about a country? There are many answers to this question, some of which may be touched upon at the conclusion of this project. But as a preliminary answer, perhaps we might say that the interaction and relationships that exists between a country's wealth, public health, and emissions gives us a glimpse into what a country prioritizes. In our example, perhaps a country prioritizes high GDP over human life. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, this project poses several challenges. I imagine a scenario in which it is difficult to create the relationship I want between these datasets. What I said above may be true, but it is one thing to say there may be a relationship and another to find. Particularly when only observing three data sets. Another potential challenge is lining up all my data together. If one data set has more countries/territories, I will have to figure out what to do with the missing data when I merge the datasets. Moreover, integrating all three files types is not something I have ever done so I am sure I will run into problems relating to different file types and ensuring they are all formatted correctly to make a merge as seamless as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "I look forward to working on this project and witnessing the inevitable transformations that my initial goals and methods will undertake."
